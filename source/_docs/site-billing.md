## Access Site Billing

<p markdown="1">Changing your site billing is typically done at launch time. For a comprehensive step-by-step guide to going live, refer to [Launch Essentials](/docs/guides/launch/).</p></div>

### Roles & Permissions
The permission to transfer ownership or update payment method is granted only to the role of **Site Owner**. You can see who is assigned the role of Site Owner by clicking **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team** in the Site Dashboard. Other roles do not have access to billing as described on this page.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">If you need to assume site and billing ownership, the current Site Owner must transfer it to you directly, as described [below](#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site).</p></div>
